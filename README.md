# MGnify-assembly-downloader
Downloads all assemblies available on MGnify. Based on the original script by https://github.com/bastiaanvonmeijenfeldt to download data from MGnify databse using its API



###  Dependencies 

```
pip install jsonapi-client
```
## How to use this tool?

first run get_analyses_and_assemblies.py to get a list of accession numbers of studies with assemblies from MGnify.
by default, these accession numbers are written to "analyses_and_assembly.txt" 
run the second script with the output of the first script. usage of the second script is available below.


```
python get_analyses_and_assemblies.py
python download_assemblies.py -i analyses_and_assembly.txt  -d list_of_integers
```
 option -d of the second script accepts a list of integers. each integer specifies what exactly you want to download from MGnify for the corresponding accession id. for example if you want to download both contigs and predicted ORFS


```
python download_assemblies.py -i analyses_and_assembly.txt -o path/to/out/dir -d 1 3
```

### how to use the second script
```
